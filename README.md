# TushehbarApp
 
This application uses ASP.Net Core 3.1.3 and the novel blazor technology. 

The main feature of the app is to find all the lines which contain a specific phrase. The implementation of the feature was done using a class named PhraseFinderService located in TushebarApp.Data namespace. This service is called in UI by index.razor page. A simple form gets the value of the phrase from user and the results are shown in a table below the form.

The spesific "file.txt" file is located in the root of the web app.
